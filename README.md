# üì¢ Twitter Sentiment Analysis

This project implements a Twitter Sentiment Analysis system using the dataset and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The system collects tweets from the dataset and classifies them as positive, negative, or neutral based on the sentiment expressed in the text. The project uses a combination of data preprocessing, feature extraction, and machine learning models to perform sentiment analysis on Twitter data.

## üöÄ Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- **Import Modules:** Python modules for data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
- **Load the Dataset:** Loads and preprocesses the Twitter dataset for sentiment analysis.
- **Preprocess Text Data:** Cleans and preprocesses text data by tokenizing and vectorizing sequences.
- **Train Test Split:** Splits the data into training and testing sets for model training.
- **Model Creation:** Defines and trains the machine learning model for sentiment analysis.
- **Evaluate the Model:** Evaluates the model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Predict Sentiment:** Predicts the sentiment of new tweets using the trained model.

## ‚¨áÔ∏è How to Use

1. **Setup Environment:**
   - Ensure Python environment is set up with necessary dependencies (`requirements.txt`).
   - Install required libraries: TensorFlow, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, etc.

2. **Dataset Preparation:**
    - Download the Twitter dataset for sentiment analysis.
    - Ensure the dataset is formatted correctly with tweet text and sentiment labels.

3. **Model Training:**
    - Run the script to load and preprocess the dataset.
    - Train the model using the prepared data, adjusting hyperparameters as necessary.
    - Evaluate the model performance on the test set.

4. **Predict Sentiment:**
    - Use the trained model to predict the sentiment of new tweets.
    - Visualize the results and analyze the model predictions.

## üéØ Evaluation

- **Model Performance:** Evaluates the model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Confusion Matrix:** Visualizes the confusion matrix to analyze the model predictions.
- **Classification Report:** Generates a classification report with precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.
- **ROC Curve:** Plots the ROC curve to analyze the model's performance across different thresholds.
- **Model Prediction:** Predicts the sentiment of new tweets using the trained model.
- **Graphical Analysis:** Visualizes the model predictions and sentiment distribution in the dataset.
